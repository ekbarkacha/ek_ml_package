# About the Author

Hello! I'm **Emmanuel Kirui Barkacha**, a student in the **African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)** program, pursuing a Master’s degree in Machine Intelligence.

This site was inspired by the coursework I'm undertaking as part of the AMMI program particularly the *Foundations to Machine Learning and Deep Learning* module. I'm especially grateful to my tutors and to **Prof. Moustapha Cissé**, whose mentorship and teaching have deeply influenced my learning journey.
